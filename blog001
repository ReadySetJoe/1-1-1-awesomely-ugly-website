In an early 2000's acceptance speech for the Nickelodeon lifetime achievement award, Will Smith said,  "Always remember, you are who you hang with." I have no idea why this has stuck with me for almost 2 decades, but it came to mind yesterday while watching everyone work their way through the lesson. I'd attempted to decipher html on my own multiple times, but never . Now, suddenly, it feels like I was handed a tome of HTML spells by a fluent speaker, and surrounded 8 other curious transplants. Every website feels like a new book of spells, and I finally feel like I'm in the room to ask a lot of really potentially dumb questions. I'm excited, and looking forward to the next 12 weeks, and can't wait to look back at this and remember how peppy and optimistic I was :)
